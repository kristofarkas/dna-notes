\chapter{Results and discussion}

This chapter describes and discusses the results. The results for each of the computational approaches to estimate either the binding free energy directly or range the intercalators is presented first, followed by a discussion of their relative merits.


\section{Docking and scoring}

The rigid planar scaffold of the intercalators that bind between DNA basepairs reduces the possible number of conformations that the docked structure can have. We have shown that using an extensive search method for docking, intercalators can be docked with RMSD less than $1$ angstrom for a wide range of intercalators compared to crystal structures.

We collected nine crystal structures of DNA-intercalator complex where the intercalator is between two consecutive basepairs. Table~\ref{tab:docking} shows the RMSD of every intercalator docked compared to the crystal structure. For seven of the cases docking is very close to the crystal structure, with average RMSD of $0.76$ angstrom. There are two cases where the docked structure is far from the reference.

After further investigating the outlier, the docked intercalators are in the correct place between the two basepairs, but their orientation is different from the one in the reference crystal structure. If there is no symmetry present in the intercalator molecule, then there are four possible orientations once docked. The free energy difference between these orientations is probably low, and the experimentally observed, dominant orientation is dependent of the kinetics of the intercalation too.

The quinoxaline scaffold based intercalators were also docked and scored into the basepair opening of the 1Z3F crystal structure removing the original intercalated molecules.
