\section{TIES}

Relative alchemical free energy calculations were done between five pairs of the intercalator from the original experimental study. As discussed above, there are two groups of intercalator there: the four and five membered ring scaffolds. Pairs were selected based on two criteria: first to maximise the experimental free energy difference and second to sample all three possible combinations of transformation (between the 4 ring systems, 5 ring systems, and a transformation from 4 ring to 5 ring).
