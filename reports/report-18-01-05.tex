\section{Intro}

I would like to give a more detailed update on my current status.

\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Binding affinity}




\subsection{AMES test}

Results are binary. This can be used to compare to simulation data, by setting a threshold to the binding affinity under which a compound is mutagen and over which it is non-mutagen.


\section{Simulation}

For all the simulation techniques that we (I) have been using here you start out the simulation from an inital structure of the ligand/intercalator inside the protein/DNA. It is not easy to get these crystal structures for DNA, hence why there is just a handful of these PDB stuctures that I can use. And even then they are not the intercalators that we want.

\subsection{Crystal stuctures}

There are crystal structures like \emph{1G3X, 3U38, 1N37, 2N4M}, which we could use as a starting point and replace the molecules with other similar ones.
