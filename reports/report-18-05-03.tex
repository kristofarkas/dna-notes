Result of MMPBSA calculations on a congeneric intercalator series interacting with a ds-DNA from a crystal structure (1Z3F). After a more careful analysis I was able to show a separation between the two ligand types (3 vs 4 membered intercalator), but in more general the correlation to experiment needs some improvement.
